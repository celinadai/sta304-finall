This paper contains the R project used in creating the paper about the relationship between location type, premises type, occurrence day of week, occurrence hour, occurrence day of the month, and offence. The data can be found on the website https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::robbery-1/about.

Abstract: This paper is about the robbery in December 2021, we are looking at the robbery in Toronto. In order to prevent crime happen in our world, analyzing the data and the region where crime occurs more frequently is a really important thing since the robbery may not only cause the victims to lose property, they also may get seriously injured. Even though we cannot prevent the future, the analysis can tell you where and when has a higher chance of a robbery that may happen. From the analysis, we used graphs and a logistic regression model, we found out that the out area and commercial areas are the places that are most likely to get robbed and the time of the robbery is likely to happen in the afternoon to midnight on weekdays.
